## Welcome to my github page!

This portfolio contains all the little things that don't end up as finished games or NDA-protected content. Some of these projects _do_ feed into games, but a lot of them are just curious expeditions into other fields of programming.

My current side-projects are mostly focused around AI and neural networks, so you can expect to see more activity on those repos.
